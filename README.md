# Through-metal Communication Prototype

## Transmitter

## Receiver

- Objective: This project was using the basics of Arduino circuits and coding. We would have to Generate a sinewave and a square wave using 4 frequencies: 250Hz, 500Hz, 125Hz, and 1kHz, and a amplitude of 1vpp. We would have to record our readings and display our results in python and compare the results.
